# Purpose: Define a function that can draw a square with user given length and character

# Draws a square with given character and length
def drawSquare(length, character):
    space = " "
    # Enter number of rows
    for i in range(length):
        # Enter number of columns
        for j in range(length):
            # Print character(s) at top/bottom row or at start/end middle rows
            if i == 0 or i == length - 1 or j == 0 or j == length - 1:
                print(character, end= space)
            else:
               print(space, end= space)
        print(space)

# Get user input
while True:
    length = int(input("Enter length: "))
    # Reprompt if integer is a negative number or zero
    if length <= 0:
      print("Invalid length.")
    # Character to draw the square with
    else:
      character = str(input("Enter character: "))
      break

# Draw the square
drawSquare(length, character)
